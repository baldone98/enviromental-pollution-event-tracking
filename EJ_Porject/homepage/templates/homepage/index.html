    <h1>Welcome to Our Environmental Justice Site</h1>
    <p>
        This site is dedicated to uncovering and discussing issues of environmental injustice
        in Tennessee. We provide insights and news updates on how environmental decisions
        impact different communities across the state, particularly focusing on how these
        decisions affect marginalized and disadvantaged groups.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our goal is to bring awareness to these critical issues and foster a community
        that can advocate for fair and equitable environmental practices. Here, you can
        find articles, analysis, and resources that help illuminate the challenges and
        actions being taken to address environmental injustice.
